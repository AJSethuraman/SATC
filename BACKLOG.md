# BACKLOG — Credit-Risk Template Suite

The shared to-do log. Statuses: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.
Anyone (human or agent) picking up work starts here; finished items move to
the bottom log with a date. Companion docs: `PROJECTS.md` (what exists),
`TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` (how everything must behave).

---

## 1 · Validation debts (needs YOUR desk — the build box can't do these)

- [ ] **Open each .xlsm in real Excel** and click ExtractFiles once
      (FRED, bureau, macro, FDIC). The embedded VBA container is
      olevba-verified but has never met desktop Excel. Fallback if any
      complain: `_code_vba` paste-in.
- [ ] **Macro template: first live FRED run** — needs your FRED_API_KEY
      (`$env:FRED_API_KEY`), then `runner.py -w <book>.xlsm` per RUN.txt.
- [ ] **FDIC template: first live run** — keyless, zero setup. Also run
      `runner.py --lookup` to verify/replace the 9 illustrative seed CERTs
      with your real peer list.
- [ ] **Bureau template: bind the live HHDC schema** — `_parse_table` is
      deliberately unbound (the NY Fed table layout was unverifiable);
      demo works fully; live needs the real column mapping (Open Q#5).

## 2 · v1.1 improvements (per shipped template)

- [ ] **FDIC:** blank stale banks' latest quarter + show STALE in the
      Watchlist status column (removes the documented median divergence);
      optional UBPR asset-band medians. (SVB metrics SHIPPED in pack v1.1.)
- [ ] **Macro:** county-level drill-down via FRED's LAUS county mirrors
      (ids must be enumerated via release 116, never constructed);
      consider `EQFXSUBPRIME*` county subprime share pending its FRED
      license note (Open Q).
- [ ] **FRED (template #1) contract-alignment pass:** it predates the
      contract — audit for the L7 clear-blocks bug class, grandfathered
      `--backend` flag, `Watchlist_Geo` tab name; align or explicitly
      re-grandfather each item.
- [ ] **Bureau:** licensed Class C adapter swap when/if a Prama-class
      feed is ever contracted (the gate opens only then).

## 3 · Next templates (researched, ranked; process per contract)

- [ ] **#7 BLS LAUS county unemployment monitor** — monthly county-FIPS
      early warning; free API key, 500 q/day. (Partially covered by the
      macro template's state lane; standalone only if county cadence
      proves valuable at your desk.)
- [ ] **Later bench:** HMDA loan-level (annual research pull), SBA 7(a)/504
      FOIA (commercial charge-offs by county+NAICS), NCUA credit-union
      sibling of FDIC, FHFA NMDB aggregates.

## 4 · Suite infrastructure ideas (unscheduled — promote when wanted)

- [x] **Provenance/tie-out (contract §12, user requirement) — SHIPPED
      for FDIC in pack v1.1** (_provenance tab + --tieout with facsimile/
      BankFind URLs); EDGAR gets accession provenance in its build;
      retrofit FRED/bureau/macro/CFPB opportunistically:** every value
      traceable to the official document — _provenance tab + `--tieout`
      mode. **Field→Call-Report mapping DONE** (fdic-peer-monitor/
      PROVENANCE_MAP_FDIC.md — MDRM codes verified against FFIEC's own
      bulk-data captions; direct facsimile URL keyed by CERT; RC-N
      column structure confirmed). Implementation lands with the
      competitor pack; EDGAR gets accession-based provenance; retrofit
      others opportunistically.
- [ ] Suite-level conformance check: one script asserting every template's
      shared modules are byte-identical, embedded code is ASCII, tabs match
      the contract, and all suites are green (CI-able).
- [x] Control Center v2 SHIPPED: status board (purpose + last run + alert
      counts read from each workbook, no opening needed), Refresh ALL
      (demo), Tie-out button, --doctor env/host check with allowlist
      guidance.
- [x] Single suite bundle SHIPPED: build_suite.py (one ASCII file = all
      template bundles + control_center; menu or --all; regenerate with
      make_suite_bundle.py — new templates join automatically).
- [x] SUITE_GUIDE.md SHIPPED: the two-page operator manual (setup, daily
      driving, which-workbook-answers-what, verification, troubleshooting).
- [ ] Regenerate the visual suite-overview page from live demo digests
      (currently hand-assembled).

- [ ] Idea (deferred): shared peer-list sync across FDIC/EDGAR workbooks —
      same banks, different keys (CERT vs CIK); needs a name-based
      crosswalk; revisit after both templates are in real use.

## 5 · Credit Review OS (`credit-review-os/` — consulting workpapers, not monitoring)

v1 (C&I loan-level engine) shipped 2026-07-05 — see Done log. Roadmap, in
order; each LOB = a new program YAML + crosswalk on the same engine:

- [ ] **Second demo bank overlay** — proves portability costs 0 code changes
      (PRD success metric).
- [ ] **LOB build-out (cash-flow-out order):** income-producing CRE →
      owner-occ CRE → construction/ADC → agricultural → consumer+residential
      (**first Mode B / product_conformance build** — schema already carries
      the mode) → multifamily / leases / specialty.
- [ ] **ASCII-bundle build-on-target** (contract §11 style) so a workbook
      crosses a bank DLP boundary.
- [ ] **Doc parsing / OCR pre-fill** — proposal lane only; deterministic core
      stays authoritative (needs its own grill/design pass).
- [ ] **Optional local LLM extraction assist** — human-confirmed proposals
      only, never in the data path, never writes a rating (own design pass).
- [ ] **ACL/CECL export** — emit classifications for the bank's allowance
      system (OCC *Allowances for Credit Losses* is the source when scoped).
- [ ] **Pin-cite confirmation sprint** — verify crosswalk page cites against
      the live regulator PDFs before the first filed workpaper.

## 6 · Standing rules for new items

New idea -> add a line here (one sentence, why it matters). New lesson
found in any build -> `TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` carried lessons (L-series),
not here. Anything touching the watchlist boundary or licensing -> gets a
research pass before a spec, no exceptions.
