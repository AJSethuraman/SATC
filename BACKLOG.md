# BACKLOG — Credit-Risk Template Suite

The shared to-do log. Statuses: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.
Anyone (human or agent) picking up work starts here; finished items move to
the bottom log with a date. Companion docs: `PROJECTS.md` (what exists),
`TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` (how everything must behave).

---

## 1 · Validation debts (needs YOUR desk — the build box can't do these)

- [ ] **Open each .xlsm in real Excel** and click ExtractFiles once
      (FRED, bureau, macro, FDIC). The embedded VBA container is
      olevba-verified but has never met desktop Excel. Fallback if any
      complain: `_code_vba` paste-in.
- [ ] **Macro template: first live FRED run** — needs your FRED_API_KEY
      (`$env:FRED_API_KEY`), then `runner.py -w <book>.xlsm` per RUN.txt.
- [ ] **FDIC template: first live run** — keyless, zero setup. Also run
      `runner.py --lookup` to verify/replace the 9 illustrative seed CERTs
      with your real peer list.
- [ ] **Bureau template: bind the live HHDC schema** — `_parse_table` is
      deliberately unbound (the NY Fed table layout was unverifiable);
      demo works fully; live needs the real column mapping (Open Q#5).

## 2 · v1.1 improvements (per shipped template)

- [ ] **FDIC:** blank stale banks' latest quarter + show STALE in the
      Watchlist status column (removes the documented median divergence);
      optional UBPR asset-band medians. (SVB metrics SHIPPED in pack v1.1.)
- [ ] **Macro:** county-level drill-down via FRED's LAUS county mirrors
      (ids must be enumerated via release 116, never constructed);
      consider `EQFXSUBPRIME*` county subprime share pending its FRED
      license note (Open Q).
- [ ] **FRED (template #1) contract-alignment pass:** it predates the
      contract — audit for the L7 clear-blocks bug class, grandfathered
      `--backend` flag, `Watchlist_Geo` tab name; align or explicitly
      re-grandfather each item.
- [ ] **Bureau:** licensed Class C adapter swap when/if a Prama-class
      feed is ever contracted (the gate opens only then).

## 3 · Next templates (researched, ranked; process per contract)

- [ ] **#7 BLS LAUS county unemployment monitor** — monthly county-FIPS
      early warning; free API key, 500 q/day. (Partially covered by the
      macro template's state lane; standalone only if county cadence
      proves valuable at your desk.)
- [ ] **Later bench:** HMDA loan-level (annual research pull), SBA 7(a)/504
      FOIA (commercial charge-offs by county+NAICS), NCUA credit-union
      sibling of FDIC, FHFA NMDB aggregates.

## 4 · Suite infrastructure ideas (unscheduled — promote when wanted)

- [x] **Provenance/tie-out (contract §12, user requirement) — SHIPPED
      for FDIC in pack v1.1** (_provenance tab + --tieout with facsimile/
      BankFind URLs); EDGAR gets accession provenance in its build;
      retrofit FRED/bureau/macro/CFPB opportunistically:** every value
      traceable to the official document — _provenance tab + `--tieout`
      mode. **Field→Call-Report mapping DONE** (fdic-peer-monitor/
      PROVENANCE_MAP_FDIC.md — MDRM codes verified against FFIEC's own
      bulk-data captions; direct facsimile URL keyed by CERT; RC-N
      column structure confirmed). Implementation lands with the
      competitor pack; EDGAR gets accession-based provenance; retrofit
      others opportunistically.
- [ ] Suite-level conformance check: one script asserting every template's
      shared modules are byte-identical, embedded code is ASCII, tabs match
      the contract, and all suites are green (CI-able).
- [x] Control Center v2 SHIPPED: status board (purpose + last run + alert
      counts read from each workbook, no opening needed), Refresh ALL
      (demo), Tie-out button, --doctor env/host check with allowlist
      guidance.
- [x] Single suite bundle SHIPPED: build_suite.py (one ASCII file = all
      template bundles + control_center; menu or --all; regenerate with
      make_suite_bundle.py — new templates join automatically).
- [x] SUITE_GUIDE.md SHIPPED: the two-page operator manual (setup, daily
      driving, which-workbook-answers-what, verification, troubleshooting).
- [ ] Regenerate the visual suite-overview page from live demo digests
      (currently hand-assembled).

- [ ] Idea (deferred): shared peer-list sync across FDIC/EDGAR workbooks —
      same banks, different keys (CERT vs CIK); needs a name-based
      crosswalk; revisit after both templates are in real use.

## 5 · Credit Review OS (`credit-review-os/` — consulting workpapers, not monitoring)

v1 (C&I loan-level engine) shipped 2026-07-05 — see Done log. Roadmap, in
order; each LOB = a new program YAML + crosswalk on the same engine:

- [x] **Second demo bank overlay** — SHIPPED 2026-07-05: `Sample State Bank`
      overlay (1-10 scale, tighter thresholds) builds on the unchanged C&I
      program; recalc tests prove threshold-flips (DSCR 1.22 vs 1.25 floor,
      leverage 3.95x vs 3.5x). 0 code changes (PRD success metric met).
- [~] **LOB build-out (cash-flow-out order):** SHIPPED 2026-07-05:
      **income-producing CRE** (NOI DSCR, occupancy, appraised-value LTV,
      rent-roll evidence), **owner-occ CRE** (occupant-business global cash
      flow per the RC-C owner-occupied definition), **construction/ADC**
      (loan-to-cost, interest-reserve depletion, as-completed LTV, draw
      inspections), **agricultural** (farm operating DSCR, carryover debt,
      farmland/chattel LTV, crop insurance) — all config + crosswalk, zero
      engine changes. Remaining (each GATED on its own grill/design pass):
      consumer+residential (**first Mode B / product_conformance build** —
      schema already carries the mode) → multifamily / leases / specialty.
      **Mode B SHIPPED 2026-07-05** (grilled with the owner same day; PRD:
      `credit-review-os/docs/prd-mode-b-product-conformance.md`; issues
      #73/#74) — per-product PS_ tabs (conformance sample grid + URCCP pool
      classification by live formula, cited to 65 FR 36903 / OCC 2000-20 /
      FDIC FIL-40-2000; overlay may tighten the clock, never loosen — loader
      enforced), rate-vs-tolerance findings (compliance per-occurrence),
      stratified random + judgmental segments with per-stratum analytics,
      computed buy-box FRINGE flag + fringe-vs-core norms block, shared test
      library with per-product knob overrides, loan-number-only identity
      (zero person names — stricter than Mode A), product-level de-identified
      mart + re-ingest. Three demo products span every URCCP branch
      (indirect auto / credit card / HELOC). Remaining LOBs (multifamily /
      leases / specialty) are config work on either mode as needed.
- [ ] **Mixed-mode workbooks** (one engagement covering commercial loan-level
      + retail conformance in one deliverable) — decided against for Mode B
      v1 (one mode per workbook); revisit if real engagements demand it.
- [ ] **Statistical sample-size calculator** (attribute sampling: confidence /
      tolerable rate → n) — decided against for Mode B v1; the documented
      stratified-random + judgmental basis is the method. Revisit on demand.
- [x] **ASCII-bundle build-on-target** — SHIPPED 2026-07-05: `credit-review
      bundle <engagement>` emits a single pure-ASCII script (contract §11
      pattern, gzip+base64) that rebuilds the workbook byte-identical in an
      empty folder on a machine with only openpyxl+PyYAML; tested for
      ASCII purity, byte-parity, and no crypto/formulas deps on target.
- [ ] **Doc parsing / OCR pre-fill** — proposal lane only; deterministic core
      stays authoritative (needs its own grill/design pass).
- [ ] **Optional local LLM extraction assist** — human-confirmed proposals
      only, never in the data path, never writes a rating (own design pass).
- [ ] **ACL/CECL export** — emit classifications for the bank's allowance
      system (OCC *Allowances for Credit Losses* is the source when scoped).
- [ ] **Pin-cite confirmation sprint (needs YOUR desk)** — verify crosswalk
      page cites against the live regulator PDFs before the first filed
      workpaper. Re-attempted 2026-07-05 from the build box: occ.gov /
      fdic.gov / federalregister.gov / cdfifund.gov all still 403 to
      automated egress — this requires a human browser.

## 6 · credit-suite — ground-up one-engine consolidation (grilled + PRD'd 2026-09-03)

The big rebuild: collapse the six copy-pasted `.xlsm` monitors into ONE shared
engine (`credit-suite/`), all ideas intact, growing to first-class Call Reports.
PRD: `credit-suite/docs/prd-credit-suite-consolidation.md`. Supersedes the
overlapping items in §2 (FRED contract-alignment — partly done 2026-09-03), §3
(#7 BLS as an adapter, not a copy), and §4 (suite conformance check → M2).

Cross-cutting principles (durable, outlive this PRD):
- Keep emailable/DLP-safe via a build-time **inliner** (shared lib at dev time,
  self-contained ASCII bundle out) — reversible to an installed package later.
- `credit-review-os` stays a SEPARATE product (borrower PII + encryption); never
  merged — it may consume engine patterns, not the reverse.
- Every value traceable to its official record (§12); entity sets are config not
  code (§13); carried lessons L1–L8 remain in force.
- Build/validate on the unlocked PC → **live** verification (live FRED+FDIC pull,
  real-Excel ExtractFiles) is part of "done", not deferred.

Phased (one effort, sequenced):
- [ ] **M1 spine:** `credit-suite` engine + inliner; migrate **FDIC + FRED**
      (the two most divergent shapes); full rigor + **cell-for-cell output parity**
      vs the current shipped `.xlsm`; live FRED/FDIC + real-Excel acceptance.
- [ ] **M2:** SCOPED 4 Sep 2026 into issues #208-#214 (7 slices, dependency-ordered).
      migrate bureau/macro/CFPB/EDGAR onto the engine; retrofit §12
      provenance to all six; suite-wide conformance CI (single-sourced modules,
      contract-shaped tabs, all green on push).
- [ ] **M3:** raw **FFIEC CDR** provider + **FR Y-9C** holding-company —
      **opens with a `research` pass** (CDR bulk Public Data Distribution vs SOAP
      webservice; RSSD vs CERT; Call Report FFIEC 031/041 vs FR Y-9C).
- [ ] **M4 bench:** NCUA, HMDA, SBA, FHFA NMDB adapters; cross-monitor peer sync
      (one entity list across FDIC CERT + EDGAR CIK via a name crosswalk).

## 7 · Standing rules for new items

New idea -> add a line here (one sentence, why it matters). New lesson
found in any build -> `TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` carried lessons (L-series),
not here. Anything touching the watchlist boundary or licensing -> gets a
research pass before a spec, no exceptions.

## Done log

- 2026-09-05 -- **Tie-out of every data point in both credit monitors:
  776 of 778 tie.** Each figure on the ours side read out of the shipped
  workbook -- the cell a person opens, never re-fetched -- and each on the
  other side taken off a document published by somebody else: a bank's own
  filed Call Report, or the agency that computes a macro series (FHFA, the
  Federal Reserve Board, S&P Dow Jones Indices), never FRED, which only
  redistributes. Twelve bank exhibits (53 lines each, 685 pages, 1,116 strips
  cut from the filings), one macro exhibit (142 series, six publishers), and a
  master roster: `credit-suite/docs/tie-out/`. Scripts in
  `credit-suite/tools/tieout/`.
  **Found six defects, every one of which left the numbers correct** and so was
  invisible to 414 passing tests: a shipped workbook with Nebraska blank after
  one unretried 5xx (fixed, `1b03896`); two series wearing each other's
  description; a mortgage-tightening indicator filed as a demand series and so
  wired to never alert; two more labels naming a different series (fixed,
  `a9411a1`); four series declaring "billions" beside a figure in millions
  (fixed, `94d431f`); and the FDIC's own quarterly and annual charge-off
  figures for PNC failing to reconcile by 515 and 652 thousand dollars -- our
  side is faithful to what the FDIC published, so nothing was adjusted.
  **Three more defects were in the checking, not the data**, each announcing
  itself as an implausibly uniform failure across every entity: C&I charge-offs
  cited to U.S. addressees only; the wrong column of the total capital ratio
  for the one bank filing two; and six blank source photographs that reported
  "ok". New guard `tests/test_fred_labels.py` checks a label against its
  publisher's own definition -- 414 tests, 4 mutations killed. PR #257.
  Still owed: the ratios and alert logic built on these figures are not
  checked, and only the latest period of each series was compared.

- 2026-09-03 -- FRED template (#1) hardening + contract-alignment pass (part of
  the §2 debt): adversarial re-verification (4 agents: test+mutation, hazard
  hunt, adversarial compute, cell-level workbook open) + fixes — engine-level
  `validate_thresholds` (L8: refuse blank/non-numeric/non-positive band an
  alert_rule reads, not silent 0.0), exit-nonzero on zero-pull, DemoProvider
  cadence-by-declared-frequency (fixed a mislabeled watchlist YoY), 3 decoration
  tests made load-bearing + `sloos_level` coverage, self-citation provenance
  (per-block vintage stamp + units + FRED HYPERLINK) + optional `fred_vintage`
  realtime pin, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`, and CI coverage (pytest-fred-dashboard
  job). 44→57 tests, all mutation-proven; live FRED + real-Excel still owed
  (needs the desk). These fold into the credit-suite M1 spine (§6).
- 2026-07-05 -- Credit Review OS v1 shipped (credit-review-os/, issues
  #60-#68 on PR #71): config-driven C&I loan-review engine — two-layer
  config (portable program + engagement overlay), per-loan linesheets with
  live-formula exceptions (doc/policy/compliance + rating disagreement),
  evidence staleness vs [ASOF], Master roll-up + criticized/classified
  totals, de-identified Data Mart + formulas-engine re-ingest,
  _methodology regulatory crosswalk (every element cited), Seam-3
  no-PII-leak guard (TIN last-4 everywhere), AES-256-GCM encryption-at-
  rest + credit-review CLI; 64 tests across the PRD's three seams,
  byte-identical deterministic builds. Roadmap lives in §5 above.
- 2026-07-03 -- Template #6 EDGAR Crit/Class Tracker shipped: commercial
  criticized/classified per competitor HC (extracted-XBRL-instance path,
  family-honest N/A gating, member-map bootstrap), 8-K credit-event lane
  with 2.04 auto-WATCH, accession provenance + --tieout/--selftest;
  16 tests, email-sim PASS, recalc parity, 94.6KB ASCII bundle verified.
  SUITE COMPLETE AT SIX -- new-build freeze; next step is the user's
  desk validation sprint (build_suite.py + --doctor + one tie-out).
- 2026-07-03 -- Template #4 v1.1 competitor pack shipped: Dashboard_LoanBook
  two-track (consumer DQ surveillance + commercial Call-Report floor),
  SVB metrics (uninsured share, unrealized/capital, FHLB), _provenance
  tab (69 field + 28 derived rows, honesty-flagged) + --tieout mode;
  20 tests, email-sim PASS, recalc parity 455 values/636 statuses,
  105KB ASCII bundle verified in empty folder.
- 2026-07-03 — Template #5 CFPB Mortgage Delinquency Monitor shipped:
  county-FIPS watchlist (the suite's finest key), [FOOTPRINT] slots,
  dev-12m + rise-streak transforms, SUPPRESSED/vintage/continuity
  handling; 16 tests, email-sim PASS, recalc parity, bundle verified.
- 2026-07-03 — Template #4 FDIC Bank Peer Monitor shipped (flexible
  [PEERS], authority-labeled thresholds, entity watchlist); L7 openpyxl
  None-write bug found + carried back to bureau/macro.
- 2026-07-02/03 — Template #3 Macro Early-Warning Monitor shipped (open
  state watchlist, staleness first-class); TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md +
  control_center.py + ASCII-bundle standard (§11) landed.
- 2026-07-02 — Bureau review pass: 16 findings fixed (heat inversion,
  IFERROR empty-cell coercion, raw_slots guard, MS-OVBA protection keys).
- 2026-06-30..07-01 — Templates #1 (FRED) and #2 (bureau) shipped; PR #53.

## 6 - Hosted practice app (satc_system) - the "hodgepodge" build-out (AJ, 2026-07-30)

The hosted app (port 5050 on the Forge) should be the practice front door:
client adder + interviewer (SHIPPED), plus:

- [x] **Email template library** SHIPPED 2026-07-31 (feat/comms-templates):
      configs/comms/ grew from two seed files to a seven-template registry
      (templates.yaml + one .txt body each) - interview invite, engagement
      letter, document request, missing items, return delivery, cover letter,
      invoice cover. Pure logic in src/satc/comms/ (library / context /
      render), thin blueprint at /comms + nav entry, 43 tests across
      tests/test_comms.py + tests/test_comms_app.py. Prefills from real state
      (document register, return refund/balance, engagement fee, vault name);
      a merge field with no fact behind it renders as a visible
      "[[ Fee: fill in ]]" marker and is listed on the screen - never guessed.
      Slots only a human can answer (meeting times, scope, fee terms, invoice
      number) get a text box. No SMTP anywhere: an ast-parsing test asserts the
      area never imports smtplib or calls sendmail. The two seed files stay
      byte-identical, so satc.drake.comms still renders them.
- [ ] **Invoice generation folded in**: port the standalone invoice-generator
      Flask app in as a satc_system piece (drop Stripe for local-first v1;
      invoice numbering, line items, PDF/HTML render, per-client history).
      Bigger job - own session.
